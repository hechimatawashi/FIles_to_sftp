# FIles_to_sftp
I needed to do some work, so I created a Python script to send a number of files generated in a specific directory in a smb shared folder via SFTP.

### Memo
- To avoid duplicate filenames and to allow for some identification of the contents, added a folder name (or _ for deep hierarchies) as a prefix to the filename.
